select name,salary from employee e1 where
N-1 = (select count(distinct salary) from employee where e2.salary>e1.salary);

select * from employee where empname like 'A%';

(select * from student1) intersect (select * from student2);//common records

select * from table where column_name%2=0; // for even numbered for alternate records
select * from table where columm_name%2=1; // for odd numbered
